       <div id = "question">How should I choose my opponent?</div>
           <div id ="answer">
             We recommend choosing your oppnent depending on which kind of fight you want. If you want a fair fight, choose someone with a similar weight, height and skill level. If you want to pummel your opponent, choose someone smaller, lighter and weaker than you. If you want to be pummeled–pick the biggest, oppent you see. If you want thought-provoking fight, pick your opponent based on interests!

       <div id = "question">Where should we fight?</div>
         <div id = "answer">If you want a safe and sterile environment where medical assistance is accessible, fights can be arranged at boxing clubs. If you want a real fight, any empty alleyway, parking garage or pasture will do.</div>
