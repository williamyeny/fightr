       <div id = "question">How should I choose my opponent?</div>
           <div id ="answer">
             We recommend choosing your oppnent depending on which kind of fight you want. If you want a fair fight, choose someone with a similar weight, height and skill level. If you want to pummel your opponent, choose someone with smaller, lighter and weaker than you. If you want to be pummeled–pick the biggest, oppent you see. If you want tought-provoking fight, pick your opponent based on interests!
